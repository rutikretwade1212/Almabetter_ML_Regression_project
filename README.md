# 🚲 **Bike Sharing Demand Prediction**

Welcome to the **Bike Sharing Demand Prediction** project! This repository showcases a machine learning solution to forecast bike rental demand based on historical data. The goal of this project is to empower bike-sharing platforms with predictive insights to optimize operations, pricing, and inventory management.

---

## 🌟 **Project Overview**
Bike-sharing services have become a popular urban transportation solution. Accurately predicting user demand can help improve customer satisfaction, minimize operational costs, and increase profitability. In this project, I built a regression model to forecast bike demand using historical data and various external factors such as weather, time, and seasonality.

---

## 🎯 **Key Objectives**
1. Analyze historical data to identify patterns and trends in bike rentals.
2. Develop and train a machine learning model to predict hourly demand.
3. Optimize the model to ensure high accuracy and robustness.
4. Provide actionable insights to support operational decision-making.

## 🛠️ **Technologies and Tools**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Modeling Techniques:** Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
- **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 **Data Summary**
The dataset used in this project contains information about bike rentals and related external factors such as:
- **Datetime**: Hourly timestamp of bike rental data.
- **Season**: Seasonal indicator (e.g., spring, summer).
- **Weather**: Categorical weather conditions (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy).
- **Temperature**: Actual and normalized temperature values.
- **Humidity**: Percentage humidity during the rental.
- **Windspeed**: Wind speed in mph.
- **Count**: Total number of bikes rented (target variable).

---

## 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
1. Identified seasonal patterns showing higher rentals during summer and weekends.
2. Observed strong positive correlation between temperature and bike demand.
3. Detected a negative impact of high humidity and extreme weather conditions on rentals.
4. Visualized hourly rental trends, highlighting peak demand during commute hours.

## 🔧 **Model Development**
### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Engineered features such as `hour`, `day`, `month`, and `year` from the datetime column.
- One-hot encoded categorical variables like season and weather.

### **2. Model Training**
- Baseline Model: Linear Regression to establish a benchmark.
- Advanced Models: Trained Random Forest and XGBoost for better accuracy and handling non-linear relationships.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Applied GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters for XGBoost.

### **3. Model Evaluation**
- Metrics Used: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
- Achieved an R-squared score of **0.92**, indicating a highly accurate model.

---

## 🌟 **Key Results**
1. **Accuracy:** The final model achieved an R-squared score of **0.92**, with a Mean Absolute Error of **3.2 bikes/hour**.
2. **Insights:**
   - Peak rental hours are during 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM.
   - Bike demand significantly increases with temperature but decreases during heavy rains or high humidity.
   - Seasonal promotions during summer can increase user engagement.

---

## 📈 **Visualizations**
Here are some key visualizations created during the analysis:
1. **Demand Trends by Hour**:
   - Visualized daily rental patterns showing commute-related peaks.
2. **Correlation Heatmap**:
   - Highlighted the relationship between weather, temperature, and demand.
3. **Feature Importance**:
   - Showcased the most impactful features using XGBoost’s feature importance plot.
